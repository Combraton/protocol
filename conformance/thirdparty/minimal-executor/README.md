# minimal-executor: an independent execution kernel (S-A)

A contracts-only third-party client for Protocol 0.1 (M6, owner decision M6-Q2). Python 3, standard library only. Run it as `python3 kernel.py --config <file> [--mutant ignores-required-boundary]`.

## Role, and what it is not

- **What it is.** An execution consumer, or kernel. It owns its dispatch boundary. For each work item it decides, from public protocol facts, whether a deterministic fake execution may be dispatched. Publishing the `dispatch.<work_id>` record **is** that dispatch.
- **What it is not.**
  - It is not an `execution/1` provider. It serves no operation, listens on no socket and claims no Execution conformance.
  - It is not an applicability engine. It decides nothing about semantic truth. It reads what the Context provider reports at the read.

## Sessions and negotiation

The kernel opens one Unix-socket session per provider per purpose. Each session runs `core.authenticate`, then `core.feature_dependencies`, then `core.negotiate`. When the query answers `method_not_found`, the kernel uses the dependencies stated in the profile documents instead. Every profile and feature listed is requested as required.

| Purpose | Provider | Profiles and features requested |
|---|---|---|
| Packet facts | `context.provider` | `context/1` with `context.required_before_start`, `context.advisory`, `context.claims`; `core/1` with its dependencies (`core.events`) and `core.grants` |
| Packet bytes | each provider named by a packet reference's `artifact.provider` | `evidence/1`; `core/1` with `core.events` and `core.grants` |
| Records | `records.provider` | `evidence/1`; `core/1` with `core.events` and `core.grants` |

`core.grants` is requested because every profile operation carries the configured grant, and CORE §5 allows a `grant` field only when `core.grants` is negotiated (DIVERGENCES TP-1).

## Behavior

At every poll (`poll_ms`, default 25), the kernel reads "now" from `clock_file`. Each undispatched item whose `dispatch_at` has passed is evaluated. The first rule that applies gives the state:

1. **`unsatisfied`.** The packet bytes cannot be fetched in full with `evidence.fetch` at the artifact's provider, or the SHA-256 of the exact bytes received differs from the reference digest.
2. **`unknown`.** `context.packet.inspect` fails, or its `reference` is not exactly the bound packet reference.
3. **`stale`.** `invalidated_items` names an item that is not advisory.
4. **`unknown`.** `unverified_items` names an item that is not advisory, or a required item's result is not `satisfied`.
5. **`current`** otherwise.

`required_before_start` work is dispatched only when the state is `current`. `advisory` work with `proceed_with_gap` is always dispatched, with `gap` true unless the state is `current`. A check record `check.<work_id>.<n>` is published whenever the state or the decision differs from the item's previous check. Records are canonical JSON, published with `evidence.upload.prepare`, `evidence.upload.append` and `evidence.seal`, with command identities derived from the artifact ID. A publication interrupted by a lost connection is retransmitted as the same commands, which replay.

Credentials are read only from the configuration file. They are never put on the command line, in the environment or in a log line; the logger also redacts them.

## Mutant

`--mutant ignores-required-boundary` evaluates and publishes honest check records, including `decision: "withhold"`. It then dispatches every due item whatever its state. Fixtures must detect it at the step that expects no dispatch.

## Coverage

- **Demonstrated** (fixture `composition.thirdparty-kernel-enforces-required-claim-boundary`). A second implementation enforces a required dispatch boundary from CONTEXT §14 read-time facts. It checks packet bytes by digest. Advisory work proceeds with its gap, and unavailable knowledge never counts as valid. It publishes its records as Evidence through public operations.
- **Not claimed.**
  - `execution/1` provider conformance;
  - the EXECUTION §13.1/§13.3 wire shapes (`context.blocked`, queue reasons, `context.checks` in `execution.inspect`);
  - admission, capacity release and transition boundaries;
  - applicability conditions the executor would observe itself;
  - restart recovery: the kernel keeps no durable journal (TP-6);
  - the Context, Knowledge and Evidence providers, which are the reference.
