# Context profile `context/1` — proposed M4 draft

> **Status: proposed draft for Protocol 0.1 milestone M4.** Nothing here is normative until M4 is accepted together with its schemas, fixtures, mutants and independent evidence. Names marked *candidate* may change during M4. Architecture: [SPEC §2, §8, §9, §14](../SPEC.md). Task: [M4](../../work/release-0.1/M4.md). Requirement IDs refer to the [matrix](../../work/release-0.1/MATRIX.md). Sources: cbr `docs/spec/PREPARATION-AND-DELIVERY.md` and `docs/spec/SPEC.md` §7, §8 at `3278393`; pio `docs/spec/STANDALONE-CLIENT.md` §5, §6 at `e65b7c0`. Owner decisions M4-Q2, M4-Q3 and M4-Q4 (2026-09-15) are incorporated.

A **context provider** prepares exact, bounded context for a named consumer and reports what it could and could not supply. CBR is one context provider; any service that compiles cited context can implement this profile. A **caller** asks for context on behalf of work it will run. A **consumer** is the execution or harness the context is for.

The profile carries **exact packets and explicit gaps**, not understanding. A delivered packet never establishes comprehension, a static explanation never establishes runtime behavior, and a coverage frontier is never a simultaneous global snapshot (SPEC §14).

The key words MUST, MUST NOT, SHOULD and MAY are used as in RFC 2119 and RFC 8174 when in capitals.

## 1. Dependencies and negotiation

- `context/1` depends on `core/1` with `core.events`, and on `evidence/1` as a **protocol dependency**: every packet revision is an exact sealed Evidence artifact (§5), so its identity, integrity, retention and fetch reuse EVIDENCE (owner decision M4-Q2). This does not require a separate running service: a standalone context provider MAY implement `evidence/1` for its own packets.
- Negotiating `context/1` does not require `evidence/1` in the same session. The packet reference names the evidence provider holding the bytes, and the reader negotiates `evidence/1` there, which may be this provider.
- **Timing semantics are negotiated explicitly** (SPEC §14): features `context.advisory`, `context.required_before_start` and `context.required_before_transition`. A request using an obligation whose feature was not negotiated is refused with `unsupported_required_feature` (CTX-9).
- Other optional features (*candidate*): `context.shared_jobs` (§4), `context.updates` (§8), `context.expand` (§6).
- A provider that cannot meet a requested boundary or delivery semantics refuses the request explicitly; it never silently degrades a required obligation (CTX-9).

## 2. Identities

| Identity | Scope and meaning | Must not be used as |
|---|---|---|
| Request subject `{ "kind": "context.request", "id" }` | One caller's request for context. The caller chooses the ID before any execution exists (CTX-1). | An execution identity or a job identity |
| Job `{ "kind": "context.job", "id" }` | The provider's preparation work. Several compatible requests may share one job (§4). | A request; cancelling it is not cancelling a request |
| Packet `{ "kind": "context.packet", "id" }` with `revision` | One immutable result revision for a request | A mutable document |
| Packet reference `{ packet, revision, artifact: { provider, artifact, digest } }` | How Execution context bindings cite a packet (EXECUTION §13). `artifact` is the exact Evidence reference of that revision's sealed bytes and the evidence provider holding them. | A reference without the artifact and digest |
| Item `item_id` | One required or advisory item within a request | A claim identity (Knowledge is M5) |

When preparation leads to admission, the execution's context binding names the request and the packet reference, so the causal link from request to execution is preserved (CTX-1).

## 3. Requests

| Operation | Kind | Semantics |
|---|---|---|
| `context.request.submit` | command | Creates the request (subject `{ kind: "context.request", id }`, precondition revision 0) |
| `context.request.cancel` | command | Cancels that request only (§4); precondition on its current revision |
| `context.request.inspect` | query | `{ request }` → state, `reason`, job, consumer, limits, item results, and `packets`: each published revision with its packet reference, `current` and `supersedes` |
| `context.packet.inspect` | query | Result facts and a bounded excerpt (§6) |
| `context.expand` | query | Newly authorized cited content (§6, `context.expand`) |

`context.request.submit` payload:

| Member | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `consumer` | `{ task, principal, executor? }`: who the context is for |
| `basis` | Target basis manifest (CTX-2): `repositories: [ { id, tree, workspace: "clean" \| "dirty" \| "unknown", dirty: { snapshot_digest } \| null } ]`, optional `environment`, `configuration` and `build`, and `completeness: "complete" \| "partial"`. Each repository keeps its own tree. A repository whose workspace is not `clean` but whose `dirty` is `null` is a commit-only basis, and the basis MUST then declare `completeness: "partial"`; otherwise the request is `invalid_envelope` at `/payload/basis/completeness`. |
| `items` | Required and advisory items (CTX-3): `{ item_id, selector: { kind, value }, obligation: "advisory" \| "required_before_start" \| "required_before_transition", transition?, reliance: "binding" \| "evidence" \| "hypothesis" \| "reference", selected_by, check }`. `selected_by` names the principal or authority that chose the item. `transition` is present exactly when the obligation is `required_before_transition`. `check` states how satisfaction is decided: `{ kind: "source_included", repository, path }`, `{ kind: "evidence_included", evidence }` or `{ kind: "authority_content_included" }` (the item's authority content at its current authority revision). "Understand the repository" is not a checkable item; an unknown check kind is `invalid_envelope`. |
| `fallback` | For advisory items only: `proceed_with_gap` or `wait_until_deadline` (CTX-7) |
| `limits` | Three separate limits (CTX-4): `deadline` (provider clock), `investigation` budget `{ units, amount }` for the provider's own work, and `output_capacity` `{ units: "bytes", amount }` for the section content of the packet. Exhausting one is reported as that limit and never as another. |
| `authority_content` | Optional binding content supplied directly by an authority: `{ item_id, evidence: reference, authority_revision }` (CTX-14) |
| `origin` | Optional, for requests made by a job's own investigation: `{ initiator, depth, call_budget }` (CTX-19) |

Outcome: `{ request, state, job?, reason?, needed? }`. Request states: `preparing`, `ready`, `partial`, `unmet`, `refused`, `cancelled`.

- An unknown obligation, reliance label or check kind is `invalid_envelope`; an obligation whose feature was not negotiated is `unsupported_required_feature` with `features`, decided at CORE §10 step 3. A provider MUST NOT accept it under another obligation.
- A request whose mandatory items cannot fit `output_capacity` ends `refused` with reason `budget_insufficient` and `needed: { units: "bytes", amount }`, the size the mandatory items need (CTX-8). A provider MUST NOT drop mandatory items to fit. Advisory content that does not fit is omitted with reason `output_capacity`.
- **After preparation** the request is `ready` when every item is satisfied, `partial` when every required item is satisfied and an advisory item is `degraded`, and `unmet` when a required item is `unmet`.
- **Item results:** `pending` while preparing; then `satisfied`, `unmet` with `reason` (`deadline_passed`, `investigation_budget_exhausted`, `output_capacity`, `corrected_during_preparation`, `unavailable`, or a provider reason), or `degraded` with `reason` for advisory items under their fallback.

## 4. Jobs, subscribers and cancellation

- A provider MAY attach a request to an existing compatible job that has not yet published: same basis, compatible access scope and compatible items. Each attached request is a separate subscriber (`context.shared_jobs`). Without that feature negotiated for the submitting session, a request always gets its own job.
- `context.request.cancel` (command) cancels **that request only**. Outcome `{ request, state: "cancelled", job, job_continues }`. The job continues while any other request still needs it (CTX-10); a cancelled request receives no further packet revisions. Cancelling a request already `ready`, `partial`, `unmet` or `refused` is `not_found`: nothing is being prepared for it. Ending the job itself is a provider decision reported as `context.job.ended` with its reason, for example an exhausted investigation budget or no remaining subscribers.
- A consumer waiting for context MUST NOT be required to hold an execution reservation (CTX-18). If preparation needs an execution, the provider submits it as an ordinary, separately authorized caller, with `origin` naming the job, its depth and call budget. Such an execution is never automatically re-enriched through the same path (CTX-19).
- **No call cycles.** The executor may read this provider's packets at any moment, including while this provider is submitting to it or waiting for its investigation. A context provider SHOULD keep answering reads while its investigation executions run, and SHOULD NOT wait for an executor while unable to answer that executor. The reference provider follows its investigations from a worker, outside its processing lock.

## 5. Results and packets

When a request reaches `ready`, `partial` or `unmet`, the provider publishes a packet revision (revision 1, or a later one under §8). The packet subject is `{ kind: "context.packet", id }` with the request's ID. Its result facts:

| Member | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `reference` | The packet reference (§2) |
| `request`, `job`, `current`, `supersedes?` | The request, the job, whether this revision is the request's current one, and the revision it supersedes (§8) |
| `selected` | Selected source revisions (`{ repository, path, tree }`) and Evidence references (CTX-5) |
| `provenance` | `{ compiler, job, basis }`: compiler and job identity, and the input basis |
| `sections` | `[ { section_id, item_id?, label, length, citations, historical } ]`, in packet order. `label` is required (CTX-20): `binding`, `observation`, `hypothesis`, `unknown`, `declared_requirement`, `source_inspected`, `runtime_observed`, `inferred` or `stale`. `historical: true` marks content kept for the record that is not current for its item (§8). |
| `inclusions` / `omissions` | Section IDs included, and `[ { item_id?, section_id?, reason } ]` with reason `output_capacity`, `authorization`, `applicability` or `unavailable` |
| `citations` | `[ { citation_id, evidence: { provider, artifact, digest } } ]` |
| `coverage` | Per-producer frontiers and gaps: `[ { producer, frontier, gaps } ]` (CTX-6). There is no global cursor. |
| `items` | `[ { item_id, obligation, result, reason? } ]` |
| `applicability` | `{ basis, conditions }`: the basis the packet is valid for, and typed invalidation conditions (§8, CTX-15) |
| `authority` | `[ { item_id, authority_revision, evidence, coverage } ]` for authority-supplied content: the revision included and what it rests on (CTX-14) |

**Packet bytes.** The sealed artifact holds `{ "format": "combraton-context-packet/1", request, revision, supersedes?, sections: [ { section_id, item_id?, label, historical, content, citations } ], items, coverage, omissions, applicability, authority }` as canonical JSON (ENCODING), with media type `application/vnd.combraton.context-packet+json`. A later format is a new `format` value.

- **Packet-to-artifact mapping** (M4-Q2). Each packet revision maps immutably to exactly one sealed Evidence artifact, named by provider, artifact and digest. The mapping is recorded when the revision is published and never changes. A later revision maps to a different artifact.
- **Exact bytes** (CTX-5). The complete packet bytes are the sealed artifact's bytes, fetched with `evidence.fetch` at the named provider. A provider MUST NOT regenerate them.
- **Missing required items stay unmet** (CTX-7). When the deadline passes, every required item not supplied is `unmet`. It is never reported `satisfied`, and it is never downgraded to advisory. Advisory items follow their declared fallback.
- **No unobserved claims** (CTX-14). Coverage frontiers name only what the provider actually ingested. A packet MUST NOT claim a frontier beyond it.

## 6. Inspect and expand

| Operation | Kind | Semantics |
|---|---|---|
| `context.request.inspect` | query | Request state, job, packet references and item results |
| `context.packet.inspect` | query | `{ packet, revision, offset?, max_bytes? }` → the result facts of §5 and an **excerpt** `{ offset, length, size, data_base64 }`: an exact byte range of the packet, bounded by `max_bytes` (default 4096) and the caller's receive limit (CTX-11). The result facts' `omissions` are its omission markers. An excerpt is never presented as the complete sealed bytes: it carries no digest, even when the range covers the whole packet. Complete bytes come from `evidence.fetch`, checked against the reference's digest. |
| `context.expand` | query | `{ packet, revision, citation, offset?, max_bytes? }` → `{ citation, evidence, excerpt }`: a byte range of the cited artifact that the principal is authorized to read, including content omitted from the packet for authorization. It needs `context.packet.read` on the packet and `evidence.read` on the cited artifact at this provider. A citation the principal may not read, a citation that does not exist and a citation held at another provider the reader must query there are all `permission_denied`, identical to each other (CTX-11, CORE-12). |

## 7. Direct fetch by an executor

Grants are provider-local (CORE §15.2): a grant's audience is the provider that issued it. A grant at the context provider therefore never authorizes a read at a different evidence provider (owner decision M4-Q3). For an executor to read a packet directly (CTX-16), the caller arranges **one grant per audience**, each held by the executor's principal and bound to the exact object:

| Audience | Right | Resource |
|---|---|---|
| The context provider | `context.packet.read` | `{ kind: "context.packet", id }` of that packet |
| The evidence provider named in the packet's artifact reference | `evidence.read` | `{ kind: "evidence.artifact", id }` of that revision's artifact |

- The executor reads the result facts at the context provider under the first grant, then fetches the bytes at the evidence provider under the second. It checks the fetched digest against the binding.
- When the context provider implements `evidence/1` for its own packets, both grants are issued there.
- A grant for another packet or artifact, a grant presented at the other provider, or a grant held by another principal is refused. Possessing a packet reference authorizes nothing.

## 8. Updates, corrections and staleness

- **Updates are new revisions** (CTX-12, `context.updates`). A finding during work is published as a new packet revision with its own basis, digest and `supersedes: { revision }`, mapped to a new artifact. Earlier revisions stay retrievable with their original artifact and digest, report `current: false`, and old bytes are never relabeled current. A provider publishes later revisions only for requests submitted in a session that negotiated `context.updates`. Delivery of an update to a running execution is an Execution observation (EXECUTION §13); a late update is recorded `late` (CTX-17).
- **Correction during preparation** (CTX-13). When an authority supplies a correction to a binding item while a job runs, a derivation made from the older binding MUST NOT become the current result for that item. The provider rebuilds within budget, marks the older result `historical`, or refuses current reliance for that item. Observably: a section derived from the older authority revision is `historical: true` with label `stale`, and the item is `unmet` with reason `corrected_during_preparation` unless a section at the corrected revision is included.
- **Stale basis** (CTX-15, owner decision M4-Q4). A packet's `applicability` carries typed, checkable **conditions**, for example `{ condition_id, kind: "repository_tree", repository, expected }`, `dirty_snapshot`, `environment_digest` or `authority_revision`. An executor bound to the packet checks, at each relevant boundary, only the conditions it can actually observe, and reports each as `match`, `mismatch` or `unavailable` (EXECUTION §13.1). The executor decides nothing about semantic truth and is not an applicability engine: conditions it cannot observe are `unavailable`, which is neither fresh nor necessarily stale.

## 9. Provider unavailability

- A consumer whose context provider is unavailable proceeds according to its obligations (SCN-8): advisory bindings proceed with a visible gap, and required bindings keep the work from being admitted as ready until they are satisfied, the deadline passes (`unmet`), or the authorized caller changes the requirement.
- A provider outage never turns a required item into `satisfied`.

## 10. Rights

| Right | Covers |
|---|---|
| `context.request` | `context.request.submit` and `context.request.cancel` on covered requests |
| `context.read` | `context.request.inspect`, events of covered requests, and events of their jobs |
| `context.packet.read` | `context.packet.inspect` and `context.expand` on covered packets (`{ kind: "context.packet", id }`) |

Expanded content and packet bytes are additionally subject to the Evidence rights of their artifacts.

## 11. Events

Context events use Core event records. *Candidate* types:

| Type | Subject | Payload |
|---|---|---|
| `context.request.changed` | request | `{ state, job?, reason? }` |
| `context.packet.published` | request | `{ reference, items }` |
| `context.job.ended` | job | `{ reason }` |
| `context.request.cancelled` | request | `{ job_continues }` |

A packet published by the provider appears as a provider-origin event (CORE §16) together with the sealed artifact's Evidence events when the provider holds the artifact itself.

## 12. Conformance and test controls

- **Reference participants only.** A reference context provider drives a **scripted preparation** selected by launch configuration: packet content per request, delays against the clock file, coverage frontiers, unmet items, mid-job corrections, budget exhaustion and outages. The script is test environment, normative only for its conformance tests (as EXECUTION §15, owner decision Q4). No fixture depends on CBR's memory engine.
- **Script vocabulary** (launch configuration `context`, test control `context.script`): `scripts` maps the ID of the request that starts a job to a list of one-key steps, and `default_script` applies otherwise. Steps: `wait_until` (an instant), `investigate` (units of investigation budget spent), `section` (`section_id`, `item_id?`, `label`, `content`, `citations?`, `authority_revision?`, `source?`), `coverage` (`producer`, `frontier`, `gaps`), `unmet` (`item_id`, `reason`), `omit` (`item_id?`, `reason`), `correction` (`item_id`, `authority_revision`), `conditions` (typed applicability conditions), `publish`, `end` (a job end reason) and `stall`. Steps advance no later than the provider's next request. A `publish` whose advisory items are unsatisfied under `wait_until_deadline` waits for the deadline.
- **Mandatory size.** For `budget_insufficient`, the reference provider counts the content of the scripted sections for required items.
- **Separate participants** (owner decision M4-Q3). Cross-profile scenarios (SCN-1, SCN-4 to SCN-6, SCN-8, SCN-9, SCN-11) run separate reference participants, one per role: context provider, evidence provider and executor, each with its own isolated store. They talk only over public protocol connections, authenticated as their own principals and authorized by grants. A shared executable is acceptable; shared stores and private calls are not.
- **Packets at a separate evidence provider.** The reference context provider, configured with an evidence provider, seals each packet revision there as an ordinary producer: it authenticates as its own principal, uses a grant issued by that provider, and uses deterministic command IDs so a retried publication replays. Until the artifact is sealed, the revision is not published and the request stays `preparing`.

## 13. What context does not establish

A packet establishes which exact bytes, with which labels, coverage and gaps, the provider produced for a request. It does not establish:
- that the consumer read, understood or followed it;
- that a labeled observation still holds after its basis changed;
- that coverage frontiers from different producers describe one moment;
- project acceptance of any claim; Knowledge reliance is M5.
